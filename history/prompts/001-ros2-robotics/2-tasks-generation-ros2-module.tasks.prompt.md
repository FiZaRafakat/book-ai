# Tasks-Generation-ROS2-Module

## User Input
```
/sp.tasks
```

## Response
Generated comprehensive task list for implementing the ROS 2 Robotics Module documentation. The tasks.md file includes:

1. Phase 1: Setup tasks for Docusaurus project initialization
2. Phase 2: Foundational elements for shared components and navigation
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1) - Chapter 1 on ROS 2 Basics with nodes, topics, services, and actions
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 (P2) - Chapter 2 on Python Control with rclpy
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 (P3) - Chapter 3 on Humanoid Structure with URDF
6. Phase 6: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels where applicable, and clear descriptions with file paths. The tasks are organized by priority following the user story requirements from the feature specification. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are clearly identified, with an MVP scope defined for the minimum viable product.

## Outcome
Successfully generated 47 specific, actionable tasks organized in phases that align with the user stories and requirements from the feature specification. The tasks follow the required format and provide a clear roadmap for implementing the ROS 2 Robotics Module documentation in Docusaurus format.
