# Prompt History Record: VLA Module Planning

## Prompt Text
continue the plan for the module 4  from where we left

## Response Text
Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics Module. Created comprehensive planning artifacts including:

- Updated implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
- Research document (research.md) resolving all technical decisions
- Data model (data-model.md) describing key entities and relationships
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) for rapid implementation
- API contracts (contracts/vla-api-contract.md) defining interfaces
- Quality checklists (checklists/requirements.md) for validation

The plan covers all three chapters as specified: Voice-to-Action Pipelines, Cognitive Planning with LLMs, and Capstone Autonomous Humanoid system. All constitution gates passed, ensuring spec-first execution, technical accuracy, developer-focused clarity, zero hallucination tolerance, full reproducibility, and Docusaurus compatibility.

## Outcome
Planning phase complete with all required artifacts generated. Ready to proceed to task generation and implementation phases.
