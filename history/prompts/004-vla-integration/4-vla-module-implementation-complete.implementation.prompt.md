# Prompt History Record: VLA Module Implementation Complete

## Prompt Text
(sp.implement is running…)

## Response Text
Successfully completed the implementation of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics Module. All 42 tasks across 6 phases have been marked as completed [X] in the tasks.md file.

The implementation includes:

1. Phase 1: Setup Tasks - Created VLA module directory structure in frontend_work/docs/vla-integration/
2. Phase 2: Foundational Elements - Updated sidebar navigation and intro documentation
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Voice-to-Action Pipelines chapter with content on speech recognition, Whisper integration, and ROS 2 translation
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Cognitive Planning with LLMs chapter covering LLM integration, task decomposition, and action sequence creation
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Capstone Autonomous Humanoid chapter with end-to-end VLA pipeline integration
6. Phase 6: Polish and Cross-Cutting Concerns - Summary content, consistency review, and quality assurance

All content files have been created and validated with a successful Docusaurus build. The module covers the complete VLA pipeline from voice recognition through cognitive planning to autonomous humanoid execution, with practical examples and exercises for students.

## Outcome
VLA module implementation complete with all 42 tasks marked as [X] in tasks.md. Module ready for use in the educational platform covering Voice-to-Action Pipelines, Cognitive Planning with LLMs, and Capstone Autonomous Humanoid systems.
