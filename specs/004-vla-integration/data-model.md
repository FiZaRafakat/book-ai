# Data Model: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics Module

## Overview
This document describes the key entities and relationships for the VLA Robotics Module educational content. Since this is primarily educational documentation, the "data model" refers to the conceptual entities and their relationships that students need to understand.

## Key Entities

### Voice Command
- **Description**: A spoken instruction from a human user that needs to be processed by the system
- **Attributes**:
  - `text`: The recognized text from speech
  - `confidence`: Confidence score of speech recognition
  - `timestamp`: When the command was received
  - `context`: Environmental context at time of command
- **Relationships**: Maps to ROS 2 Action Sequence

### LLM Planner
- **Description**: The cognitive component that translates natural language into executable robot action sequences
- **Attributes**:
  - `model_type`: Type of LLM being used (GPT-4, local model, etc.)
  - `context_window`: Current context for planning
  - `task_decomposition`: Breakdown of complex tasks
- **Relationships**: Processes Voice Command, generates ROS 2 Action Sequence

### ROS 2 Action Sequence
- **Description**: A series of commands sent to the robot to accomplish a specific task
- **Attributes**:
  - `actions`: Ordered list of individual robot actions
  - `parameters`: Parameters for each action
  - `dependencies`: Order constraints between actions
  - `safety_constraints`: Safety limits for execution
- **Relationships**: Executed by Simulated Robot, generated by LLM Planner

### Simulated Robot
- **Description**: A virtual robot in simulation environment that executes commands from the VLA system
- **Attributes**:
  - `state`: Current state (position, battery, gripper status, etc.)
  - `capabilities`: Available actions the robot can perform
  - `environment`: Current simulation environment
  - `sensors`: Available sensor inputs
- **Relationships**: Executes ROS 2 Action Sequence

### VLA Pipeline
- **Description**: The integrated system that connects voice input, language processing, and robotic action execution
- **Attributes**:
  - `components`: List of pipeline components (voice, language, action)
  - `state`: Current pipeline state
  - `execution_context`: Context for current execution
- **Relationships**: Orchestrates all other entities

## Relationships

```
Voice Command → LLM Planner → ROS 2 Action Sequence → Simulated Robot
      ↓              ↓                 ↓                  ↓
   (processed)   (planned)        (executed)        (acted)

All components are coordinated by the VLA Pipeline
```

## State Transitions

### Voice Command State
- `RECEIVED` → `RECOGNIZED` → `PROCESSED` → `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`

### ROS 2 Action Sequence State
- `PLANNED` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`

### VLA Pipeline State
- `IDLE` → `PROCESSING_COMMAND` → `EXECUTING` → `COMPLETED` or `ERROR`

## Validation Rules

1. **Voice Command Validation**: Commands must be safely interpretable and executable
2. **Action Sequence Validation**: Sequences must respect robot capabilities and safety constraints
3. **State Consistency**: Robot state must be consistent with executed actions
4. **Context Preservation**: Environmental context must be maintained across pipeline steps
