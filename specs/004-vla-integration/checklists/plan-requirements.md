# Implementation Plan Quality Checklist: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics Module

**Purpose**: Validate implementation plan completeness and quality before proceeding to execution
**Created**: 2025-12-18
**Feature**: [Link to plan.md](./plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] Plan focuses on implementation approach and technical architecture
- [ ] Plan avoids unnecessary implementation details for future phases
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed (Architecture, Strategy, Dependencies)

## Requirement Alignment

- [ ] All functional requirements from spec are addressed in implementation tasks
- [ ] Success criteria from spec are validated in the plan
- [ ] User stories from spec are mapped to implementation phases
- [ ] Edge cases from spec are considered in implementation approach

## Implementation Completeness

- [ ] Setup tasks defined (directories, configuration, navigation)
- [ ] Content creation tasks for all 3 chapters defined
- [ ] Integration tasks between components identified
- [ ] Validation and testing tasks included
- [ ] Dependencies between phases clearly defined
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies documented

## Task Quality

- [ ] Tasks are specific and actionable
- [ ] Tasks have clear deliverables (file paths, expected outcomes)
- [ ] Tasks are assigned appropriate priority levels
- [ ] Tasks follow logical sequence and dependencies
- [ ] Each phase has clear success validation criteria

## Build and Deployment

- [ ] Docusaurus build process considered and validated
- [ ] Navigation and user experience addressed
- [ ] Cross-module integration planned
- [ ] Quality assurance steps included

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require plan updates before `/sp.tasks`
